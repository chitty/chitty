## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys solving complex problems and making systems simpler, faster, and easier to work with. I've worked on high-scale systems at Shopify, led billing platform refactors, and mentored teammates through architectural changes
and upgrades. I care about building technology that supports human well-being and I bring a thoughtful, collaborative mindset to every project I join.
