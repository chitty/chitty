I'm a full stack engineer with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. I've worked at scale with companies like Shopify, traveled the world while building software remotely, and contributed to open-source communities. I'm driven by purpose, community, and continuous learning.

I aim to live intentionally and build tools that simplify and improve life. I'm passionate about education, wellness, fitness, financial markets, community, and parenting. I'm currently looking for place where I can grow as an engineer and a human, surrounded by people who care about making a difference.
