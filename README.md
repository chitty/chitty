I’m a Software Engineer with a track record of improving product reliability, team workflows, and system maintainability. I’ve led billing refactors at Shopify, driven critical upgrades, and helped teams take ownership of their systems through clear code structure, alerting, and documentation. I bring strong judgment, initiative, and care to every project.  I care deeply about building technology that has a positive impact, and about growing alongside people who want to make a real difference.
